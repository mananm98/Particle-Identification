# Particle-Identification

Task is to train a classifier to identify type of a particle. There are six particle types: electron, proton, muon, kaon, pion and ghost. Ghost is a particle with other type than the first five or a detector noise.
Different particle types remain different responses in the detector systems or subdetectors. Thre are five systems: tracking system, ring imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH), electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, and muon system.
